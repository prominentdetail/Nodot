# Nodot
A javascript pixel-art editor

The editor can be used online at https://prominentdetail.github.io/Nodot/

Collaboration on this project is welcome!

For this editor, I don't want to use any premade libraries like jQuery.
The focus of this project is to create a very clean/lightweight and simple editor for pixel-art without sacrificing any standard functionality.
